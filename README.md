In my Software Project Management project, I actively engaged in product management tasks. This experience provided me with hands-on opportunities to contribute to various elements of the product management lifecycle. Specifically, I was involved in defining the Product Vision, creating the Product Backlog, developing User Stories, estimating Product Backlog Items, and designing Wireframes for the web version of My Petpal. This practical application allowed me to gain valuable insights into the world of product management.
